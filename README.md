# Peaksware JS Quiz

1	Using a MVC/MVVM/Module framework of your choice (existing Open Source like BackboneJS, Knockout, JavascriptMVC, etc, or your own self-spun framework/modules), create a client application to graphically display workout performance data on a canvas-based graph and display a GPS path on a tile-based map.

2	Enable the user to highlight a section of the graph, and automatically highlight the corresponding section on the GPS track. 

3) Finally, calculate the best average power for 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. You should use an efficient algorithm that runs in multiple threads.

## Recommendations
We recommend the following libraries to assist you:
Graphing: Highcharts, Highstock, or Flot
Map: Google Maps API V3, OpenStreetMaps, Leaflet

We realize this interview question can be a substantial task. To save time, do not focus too much on CSS styling, layouts, boundary use cases, etc.

We do care a lot about the following:

- Code cleanliness, code efficiency (more code is not always better), algorithm
efficiency, and overall architectural layout of the code/modules.
- Displaying in-depth understanding of Javascript through anonymous functions or closures, for example, the use of common patterns to privatize members, if necessary, or other advanced concepts.
